JavaScript is a programming language that reports its error much later than many other languages. Variables can take any shape in JavaScript. That is, for instance, a number or a string. This can at first seem as good that the language is highly dynamic and flexible. This flexibility is also very error-prone, where most of the errors are discovered after the code is run. This results in being obliged to test running the code after every change\cite{taivalsaari2008web}. TypeScript was created to fix the error-prone nature of JavaScript. TypeScript is an open-source programming language that is built upon JavaScript. TypeScript allows for the creation of types for variables, functions, etc., and thereby helps to find more errors before runtime. TypeScript then complies back to JavaScript before it is run and can thereby run everywhere JavaScript run.
