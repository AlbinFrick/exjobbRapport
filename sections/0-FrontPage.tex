\begin{abstract}
\textit{Creating modern web applications is often done with a modular mindset with components. These components are very useful and do not need to be redesign between projects if the design language is the same. However, if there is a need to have components with different design languages between each project creating components can feel unnecessary. This thesis in collaboration with Knowit Experience tries to solve this problem by creating an open-source prototype that converts components from the user interface design program Figma into web components. The thesis shows how to make this prototype user-friendly by usability testing and how to measure the effectiveness of this prototype with A/B testing. The results of the thesis are a working open-source prototype that is user-tested for all basic features. The A/B testing is handed over to a later study because of the pandemic and a 20 week time constraint on the project.}
